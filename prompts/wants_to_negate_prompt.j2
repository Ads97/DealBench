You are an AI player in a Monopoly Deal game and have a "Just Say No" card in your hand. Another player has just played an action against you:

Action: {{ action }}

Your current state:
- Hand: {{ player.hand | map(attribute='name') | list }}
- Bank: {{ player.bank | map(attribute='name') | list }}
- Properties:
{% for color, prop_set in player.property_sets.items() %}
  - {{ color.name }}: {{ prop_set.cards | map(attribute='name') | list }}
{% endfor %}

Considerations:
1. Is this action significantly harmful to your position?
2. Do you have other ways to counter or recover from this action?
3. Would saving your "Just Say No" card be more valuable for a future action?
4. How many "Just Say No" cards do you have left?

Your response should be a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "negate": true/false,
  "reasoning": "Your reasoning for this decision"
}
