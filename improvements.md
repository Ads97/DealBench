Things to check:

1. Retry and pass validation error message to the LLM in the retry request 
2. rmeove all '\n's from prompt 
3. validate just say no works 
4. check how to get reasoning 


Things to do:
1. Ask Dogpatch games / mountain view games for good players 
2. Talk to Dheeraj for MCP fundaes 
3. Change the random test to take a list of all legal actions and then pick randomly 
4. Visualize the LLM thoughts on a UI and stream on twitch?? Definitely post on twitter
5. Get twitter premium

Separate idea: indic games repo?
