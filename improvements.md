Things to check:

1. should action have player objects in it
2. how do I ensure source player is autofilled so it doesn't need to be passed everytime
3. Should I separate out player functions and functions that update player state 



Things to do:
1. Ask Dogpatch games / mountain view games for good players 
2. Talk to Dheeraj for MCP fundaes 
3. Change the random test to take a list of all legal actions and then pick randomly 
4. Visualize the LLM thoughts on a UI and stream on twitch?? Definitely post on twitter
5. Get twitter premium

Separate idea: indic games repo?
