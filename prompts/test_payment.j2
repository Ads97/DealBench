Payment rules:
1. You must pay the exact amount if possible
2. You can use any combination of money cards from your bank and property cards from your property sets

Your response MUST be a JSON array with reasoning and a tuple of card names (exact) and source (bank or properties) to use for payment, for example:
{
  "reasoning": "Reasoning on the cards you want to use to pay.",
  "payment": "[(card_name_1, bank), (card_name_2, properties)]"
}

If you have absolutely no bank or property cards to pay with, return an empty array [] for "payment". If the sum total of your bank and property cards is less than the amount you need to pay, return all your bank and property cards in "payment".
