Things to do:
1. run more games at the same time 
2. find a way to reduce gemini and claude costs 

Tournament
Players:
1. o4-mini (1.1 input, 4.4 output) ~5 cents a game
2. o3 (2 input, 8 output) ~10 cents a game
3. claude sonnet 4 (3 input, 15 output) ~15 cents a game (nope)
4. claude opus 4 (15 input, 75 output) ~75 cents a game (not now too expensive)
5. gemini 2.5-pro (1.25 input, 10 output) (~10 cents a game) (works)
6. deepseek r1 (0 input, 0 output) # problematic actions and server 500s
7. random turn bot (0 input, 0 output)


Things to do:
1. Ask Dogpatch games / mountain view games for good players 
2. Talk to Dheeraj for MCP fundaes 
3. Change the random test to take a list of all legal actions and then pick randomly 
4. Visualize the LLM thoughts on a UI and stream on twitch?? Definitely post on twitter
5. Get twitter premium

Separate idea: indic games repo?


Bug: (What I think happened):
1. Randy had a wild (lt blue/brown) which he had set to light blue 
2. Openai o4-mini acquired the property through debt collection
3. Openai o4-mini used move property to move it to property set brown 
4. Openai 04-mini tried adding another card to the property set and it broke because wild card still had color set as light blue. 

Question: Do we want to allow step 2 -> step 4 without doing step 3? even if we dont we should not crash in this case.
