You are an AI player in a Monopoly Deal game and have a "Just Say No" card in your hand. Another player has just played an action against you:

Action: {{ action }}

Your current state:
- Hand: {{ player.hand | map(attribute='name') | list }}
- Bank: {{ player.bank | map(attribute='name') | list }}
- Properties:
{% for color, prop_set in player.property_sets.items() %}
  - {{ color.name }}: {{ prop_set.cards | map(attribute='name') | list }}
{% endfor %}

Your response should be a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "reasoning": "Reasoning on whether you want to play the just say no card",
  "use_just_say_no": True/False,
}
