# Guidance
- Only include fields relevant to the action you are taking. Fill the rest with 'null'.
- Always use the exact card name as it appears in your hand or properties.
- For Rent, specify rent_color and double_the_rent_count if using Double the Rent cards.
- For actions targeting other players or property sets, always specify the correct player names and property set colors.
- If you are unsure, refer to the above examples.

Choose the one best card to play based on the current game state. Your response must be a single JSON object in the above format.
