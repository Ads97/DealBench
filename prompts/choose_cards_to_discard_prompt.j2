{% from 'game_state_display.j2' import display_game_state %}
You are an AI player in a Monopoly Deal game and need to discard {{ num_cards_to_discard }} cards.

{{ display_game_state(game_state, actions_per_turn, player) }}

Choose {{ num_cards_to_discard }} cards to discard. Prioritize cards that are less useful for your current strategy. Consider:
1. Excess money cards if you already have enough
2. Properties that don't fit your current sets
3. Action cards that are less useful in the current game state

Your response should be a JSON array of card names to discard, for example:
[
  "Card Name 1",
  "Card Name 2"
]
