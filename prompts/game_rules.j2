Agent Deal Game Rules:
How to win: Be the first player to collect 3 complete property sets. Each set must be a different colour. For example: you can't win with 2 red sets and 1 blue set. 

Who goes first: The play order is randomly decided at the beginning of the game. 

On your turn: 
1. Draw two cards: If you ever start your turn with no cards, draw 5 instead. 
2. Play up to 3 cards of any type. You may choose to play none. 
- Playing Cards: There are three ways to play cards. You don't have to do all of these in one turn (remember, you don't even have to play any cards at all). Once you play a card, you can't put it back in your hand. See the cards section to know about them. 
- Add to your bank by placing money or action cards with a value in it. Use action type ADD_TO_BANK to add to the bank. Action cards are worth the amount shown in the 'value' field. Once you place an action card in your bank, think of it as a money card - you can't do the action on it once it's in there. You'll need money in your bank to pay other players. 
- Add a property to your collection using the action type ADD_TO_PROPERTIES. You may place as many properties as you want throughout the game, but remember you need 3 complete sets of different colours to win. 
- Play an action card by using the action type PLAY_ACTION. The action card gets discarded when done - except house and hotel cards, which get added to your property sets. 
3. At the end of your turn, you may have up to 7 cards in your hand. If you have more than 7, you will be asked to discard some cards. (it's okay to end your turn with no cards!)

Paying other players: Owe another player money? You can pay in two ways:
1. Pay from your Bank. Give the player the money or action cards from your Bank, which go to the other player's Bank. 
2. Pay with your properties. Properties are worth the amount shown in the "value" field and go to the other player's property collection. Properties never go in the Bank!

You choose how you want to pay, not the player you're paying. Never pay with cards from your hand. if you don't have enough in your Bank, then you must pay with your properties! 

There's no change in this game, so you may have to pay more than what you owe if that's all you have. For example: if you owe $2Million, have a $5Million if your Bank and no properties, then you must give them $5Million. 
If you don't have enough money or properties, just pay what you can. If you have no money or properties, nothing happens. 
You can't pay with cards from your hand.
